"""Centralized bot configuration loader.

This module tries to read environment variables for the Telegram bot without
breaking the Django build steps (e.g. during ``collectstatic`` in a Docker
image build) where the secret ``.env`` file is often not copied into the
image (it's ignored by ``.dockerignore``) and environment variables from
``docker-compose.yml`` are NOT yet applied.

Key points:
1. We attempt to locate a .env file in a few likely locations (project root, bot/, current working dir).
2. We never hardâ€‘fail if BOT_TOKEN is missing at import time; instead we provide
   a placeholder so that static collection and admin commands still work.
3. Runtime code that actually needs a valid token (sending telegram messages)
   should gracefully handle a placeholder / empty token.
