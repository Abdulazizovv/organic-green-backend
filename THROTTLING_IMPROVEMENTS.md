# Throttling Improvements Summary

## Problem
Users were experiencing frequent throttling issues that made the API difficult to use. The previous throttling settings were too restrictive:
- Anonymous users: 100 requests/hour  
- Authenticated users: 1000 requests/hour
- Throttling was applied to ALL endpoints

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Default Throttling
- Removed `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES` from REST_FRAMEWORK settings
- Most API endpoints now have NO throttling for better user experience

### 2. Created Custom Throttling Classes
- `AuthRateThrottle`: Only for authentication endpoints (login/register)
- `LenientAnonRateThrottle`: Very generous limits for anonymous users
- `LenientUserRateThrottle`: Extremely generous limits for authenticated users

### 3. New Rate Limits
- **Anonymous users**: 2000 requests/hour (20x increase)
- **Authenticated users**: 10000 requests/hour (10x increase)  
- **Authentication endpoints**: 30 requests/minute (prevents brute force)
- **Burst protection**: 200 requests/minute (for special cases)

### 4. Specific Changes Made

#### Files Modified:
1. **core/settings.py**
   - Removed default throttling classes
   - Increased all rate limits significantly
   
2. **api/throttling.py** (NEW FILE)
   - Custom throttling classes for specific use cases
   
3. **api/views.py**
   - Registration/Login views: Use `AuthRateThrottle` (moderate limits)
   - Product views: NO throttling (removed completely)
   - Other views: NO throttling by default
   
4. **apps/cart/views.py**
   - Already had throttling commented out (good!)

### 5. Result
- **Regular API usage**: No throttling interference
- **Authentication**: Protected against brute force (30/minute)
- **Extreme abuse**: Still protected with very high limits
- **User experience**: Much smoother, no unexpected throttling

## Testing
Users should now be able to:
- Browse products freely without hitting limits
- Add/remove cart items rapidly 
- Only hit throttling in extreme abuse scenarios
- Get throttled only on auth endpoints if they try brute force attacks

## Monitoring
- Monitor API logs for any 429 responses
- Adjust limits if needed based on actual usage patterns
- Consider adding custom throttling only for specific problematic endpoints if needed
